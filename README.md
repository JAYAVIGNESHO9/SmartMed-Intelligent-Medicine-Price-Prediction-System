# SmartMed-Intelligent-Medicine-Price-Prediction-System
Smart Medicine Price &amp; Availability Predictor is a machine learning–based project that predicts the estimated price of medicines based on key attributes such as pack size and availability status. The project demonstrates a complete ML workflow including data preprocessing, model training, and real-time price prediction using Python.
# 💊 Smart Medicine Price & Availability Predictor

## 📖 Overview
The **Smart Medicine Price & Availability Predictor** is a machine learning project designed to estimate the price of medicines using essential product-level attributes.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how data preprocessing, feature selection, and regression models can be used to build a simple yet practical predictive system in the healthcare domain.

This project focuses on **learning and implementation** rather than replacing official pricing systems.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Medicine prices can vary based on multiple factors such as pack size, availability, and discontinuation status.  
For students, developers, and researchers, understanding how such factors influence pricing is important when working with healthcare-related datasets.

This project aims to analyze medicine-related data and build a predictive model that can estimate prices using machine learning techniques.
